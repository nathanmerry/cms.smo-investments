        "legal": "<b>Payday Ventures Limited is a licensed credit broker and not a lender. We are an affiliate of Pingtrees in the UK who have access to a database of loan partners. The Pingtrees will submit your application to their panel of lenders and finance providers. If the Pingtree is unable to find you a lender, the Pingtree could find you an alternative solution, which might be debt help or a credit score option so you can improve your financial position. </b><br><br>\n<b>APR:</b> The APR provided above is an example only, the rate offered will be shown after your application by the lender.\n<br><br>\n<b>Fees & Credit Score:</b> Receiving this loan will affect your credit score. Failure to make repayments would have negative impact and fees may be charged by the lender.\n<br><br>\n<b>Renewal Policy:</b> The renewal policy by the lender is completely dependent on your circumstance. We recommend fully evaluating your offer upon it being provided.\n<br><br>\n<b>Collection Practices:</b> Once you have received your payday or instalment loan amount, if for any reason you think you will be unable to meet any arranged repayments, or if you think there will be any difficulty repaying any part of your loan, then you must contact the provider of your loan directly as soon as you become aware.<br>br>\nContacting your lender will provide you with the best opportunity to perhaps reschedule your loan repayments or discuss further options in more detail to avoid adverse action. Changing repayments of your loan amount could incur further charges or interest, the details of which can only be discussed directly with the lender of your payday or instalment loan. If no attempt is made to contact your lender and update them on any circumstantial changes or make the lender aware of any difficulty in paying back what you owe; they reserve the right to pass on your details to third party debt collections agencies or organisations that will attempt to recover the debt.<br>br>\nLenders usually reserve the right to utilise the Continuous Payment Authority to continue to attempt to take payment from your card up to 90 days past your due date. This is only done if it is in line with the terms of your agreement. Please check your own Terms and Conditions on your signed loan agreement for details.\n<br><br>\n<b>Non Payment Implications:</b> The implications of non-payment of your loan could include adverse details being included within your credit report. This could adversely affect future attempts at securing credit or finance, in addition to further charges potentially being added by the lender. Where you miss a payment entirely, you will often incur a charge/fee that will be added on to the total amount that you owe. Upon a missed payment, lenders will often try to contact you by telephone or letter in order to recover the funds and they may be able to arrange a new re-payment date with you. If you are struggling, or think there is a possibility that you will not be able to meet repayments, Payday Ventures Limited strongly recommends that you contact the lender in the first instance.<br><br>\n<b>Borrow Responsibly:</b> Payday loans are designed to be able to help people in the need of a quick and short solution and should not be used for long term borrowing under any circumstance.<br><br>\n<b>Consumer Advisory:</b> Payday Ventures Limited is a loan matching service. This site will submit the information you provide to a direct lender through one of the Pingtrees we are affiliated with. Upon loan approval, a direct lender may require further information from you which will be collected after we transfer you to their website or they may contact you via phone or email.<br><br>\nThe operator of this site is not a direct lender. Loan terms, conditions and policies vary by lender and applicant qualifications. Late or missed loan payments may be subject to increased fees and interest rates. Not all lending partners offer up to �2,000 loans, and not all applicants will be approved for their requested loan amounts. Loan repayment periods vary by lender also. Lenders may use collection services for non-payment of loans.<br><br>\nNot all borrowers will qualify for a loan, the operator of this website does not engage in any direct consumer lending, we simply provide a FREE loan matching service to the public. To operate this service we receive a commission from the lender we refer you to.<br><br>\n<b>All loans are subject to status and only available to UK residents aged 18 and over.</b><br><br>\n<b>Responsible Lending:</b> Carefully consider whether a loan is right for your individual financial situation. Depending on the amount borrowed and the duration of the loan you may find that borrowing of this type is an expensive form of credit and not appropriate for much longer term borrowing or if you are in financial difficulty. All loan applications are subject to status, terms and conditions and to satisfactory passage of checks on creditworthiness and affordability.<br><br>\n*Subject to lender approval. Cash can only be paid fast if your bank accepts faster payments. If not cash could take 24 to 48 hours to arrive. Payday Ventures will not perform a credit check as part of the application process, however if you are accepted by a lender, a full credit check will be carried out.\n<br><br>\n<b>Important things to remember:<br><br>\nDon't borrow money if you know you will struggle to pay it back. Don't ignore the situation, contact your lender as your first port of call.</b> Please be aware that if do not repay your loan at the agreed date between yourself and your lender, this will result in your lender reporting your case to the Credit Reference Agencies; which may have a negative effect on your credit score. This may negatively impact your ability to obtain credit in the future for services such as car finance, mobile phone contracts or satellite TV subscriptions. If you default, you may be charged a collection fee (which varies from one lender to another), plus interest on the balance outstanding at the interest rate payable under the agreement. You must pay your lender any reasonable expenses and costs that may be incurred in taking steps to enforce (for example, via County Court Judgments), or attempt to enforce, the lenders rights against you under your agreement.\n",

        "legal": "<b>SMO Investments Limited is a licensed credit broker and not a lender. We are an affiliate of Pingtrees in the UK who have access to a database of loan partners. The Pingtrees will submit your application to their panel of lenders and finance providers. If the Pingtree is unable to find you a lender, the Pingtree could find you an alternative solution, which might be debt help or a credit score option so you can improve your financial position. </b><br><br>\n<b>APR:</b> The APR provided above is an example only, the rate offered will be shown after your application by the lender.\n<br><br>\n<b>Fees & Credit Score:</b> Receiving this loan will affect your credit score. Failure to make repayments would have negative impact and fees may be charged by the lender.\n<br><br>\n<b>Renewal Policy:</b> The renewal policy by the lender is completely dependent on your circumstance. We recommend fully evaluating your offer upon it being provided.\n<br><br>\n<b>Collection Practices:</b> Once you have received your payday or instalment loan amount, if for any reason you think you will be unable to meet any arranged repayments, or if you think there will be any difficulty repaying any part of your loan, then you must contact the provider of your loan directly as soon as you become aware.<br>br>\nContacting your lender will provide you with the best opportunity to perhaps reschedule your loan repayments or discuss further options in more detail to avoid adverse action. Changing repayments of your loan amount could incur further charges or interest, the details of which can only be discussed directly with the lender of your payday or instalment loan. If no attempt is made to contact your lender and update them on any circumstantial changes or make the lender aware of any difficulty in paying back what you owe; they reserve the right to pass on your details to third party debt collections agencies or organisations that will attempt to recover the debt.<br><br>\nLenders usually reserve the right to utilise the Continuous Payment Authority to continue to attempt to take payment from your card up to 90 days past your due date. This is only done if it is in line with the terms of your agreement. Please check your own Terms and Conditions on your signed loan agreement for details.\n<br><br>\n<b>Non Payment Implications:</b> The implications of non-payment of your loan could include adverse details being included within your credit report. This could adversely affect future attempts at securing credit or finance, in addition to further charges potentially being added by the lender. Where you miss a payment entirely, you will often incur a charge/fee that will be added on to the total amount that you owe. Upon a missed payment, lenders will often try to contact you by telephone or letter in order to recover the funds and they may be able to arrange a new re-payment date with you. If you are struggling, or think there is a possibility that you will not be able to meet repayments, SMO Investments Limited strongly recommends that you contact the lender in the first instance.<br><br>\n<b>Borrow Responsibly:</b> Payday loans are designed to be able to help people in the need of a quick and short solution and should not be used for long term borrowing under any circumstance.<br><br>\n<b>Consumer Advisory:</b> SMO Investments Limited is a loan matching service. This site will submit the information you provide to a direct lender through one of the Pingtrees we are affiliated with. Upon loan approval, a direct lender may require further information from you which will be collected after we transfer you to their website or they may contact you via phone or email.<br><br>\nThe operator of this site is not a direct lender. Loan terms, conditions and policies vary by lender and applicant qualifications. Late or missed loan payments may be subject to increased fees and interest rates. Not all lending partners offer up to �2,000 loans, and not all applicants will be approved for their requested loan amounts. Loan repayment periods vary by lender also. Lenders may use collection services for non-payment of loans.<br><br>\nNot all borrowers will qualify for a loan, the operator of this website does not engage in any direct consumer lending, we simply provide a FREE loan matching service to the public. To operate this service we receive a commission from the lender we refer you to.<br><br>\n<b>All loans are subject to status and only available to UK residents aged 18 and over.</b><br><br>\n<b>Responsible Lending:</b> Carefully consider whether a loan is right for your individual financial situation. Depending on the amount borrowed and the duration of the loan you may find that borrowing of this type is an expensive form of credit and not appropriate for much longer term borrowing or if you are in financial difficulty. All loan applications are subject to status, terms and conditions and to satisfactory passage of checks on creditworthiness and affordability.<br><br>\n*Subject to lender approval. Cash can only be paid fast if your bank accepts faster payments. If not cash could take 24 to 48 hours to arrive. SMO Investments will not perform a credit check as part of the application process, however if you are accepted by a lender, a full credit check will be carried out.\n<br><br>\n<b>Important things to remember:<br><br>\nDon't borrow money if you know you will struggle to pay it back. Don't ignore the situation, contact your lender as your first port of call.</b> Please be aware that if do not repay your loan at the agreed date between yourself and your lender, this will result in your lender reporting your case to the Credit Reference Agencies; which may have a negative effect on your credit score. This may negatively impact your ability to obtain credit in the future for services such as car finance, mobile phone contracts or satellite TV subscriptions. If you default, you may be charged a collection fee (which varies from one lender to another), plus interest on the balance outstanding at the interest rate payable under the agreement. You must pay your lender any reasonable expenses and costs that may be incurred in taking steps to enforce (for example, via County Court Judgments), or attempt to enforce, the lenders rights against you under your agreement.\n",
